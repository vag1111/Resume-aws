							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/uscloud.jpg" alt="" /></span>							<p> I decided to take on a unique resume challenge to stand out in the competitive tech industry. My journey began when I first enrolled on a challenging four month boot camp through an organization Per Scholas, they offer a variety of technology courses and I chose to do the AWS Re/start Program, this would be a program that would push me out of my comfort zone but at the same time I would meet great people and learn new skills.. </p>
							<p>The first step was clear - obtain the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. I enrolled in the online exam, which cost $100 USD, and armed myself with exam prep resources from Per Scholas and guidance from my amazing proffesors.

								With my certification proudly in hand, I moved on to the next step - transforming my resume into a tech masterpiece. No more traditional Word documents or PDFs; it had to be crafted in HTML. I took inspiration from provided examples to ensure my resume was coded with precision.
								
								Realizing that style matters, I delved into the world of CSS to add a touch of professionalism to my HTML resume. I wasn't a designer, but the goal was to present more than just raw HTML when someone opened the webpage.</p>
								
							<p>Now, with a polished and stylized resume, it was time to showcase it to the world. The resume had to be more than a file saved on my computer; it needed to be a static website. Amazon S3 was the chosen platform for deployment, offering simplicity and effectiveness.
								
								Security was paramount, so I ensured that my S3 website used HTTPS. To achieve this, I integrated Amazon CloudFront into the mix, enhancing the security of my online presence.
								
								To make it even more personalized, I wanted my resume to have its own domain name. I registered a custom DNS domain name, opting for the memorable "my-c00l-resume-website.com." Amazon Route 53 facilitated the connection, allowing users to access my resume with a simple and professional domain.
								
								In the end, my resume had undergone a remarkable transformation - from a traditional document to a certified, HTML-coded, CSS-styled, HTTPS-secured, and domain-named masterpiece. This unique journey not only showcased my technical skills but also demonstrated my commitment to innovation and going the extra mile.
